1. Build a nice box (div) with some content (e.g. "I'm a box!"), padding, a border (style it as you want) and some margin.
2. If you didn't do it already: Set different padding and margin for the four different sides of the box.
3. Add the same box below the first box and note if you can identify any strange behavior.
4. Give the first box a height of 100% of the window height.
5. Set the first box back to a more reasonable height of 300px and set its width to 50%.
6. Position the two boxes next to each other.
7. "Hide" box number 1 and see how that changes the page.
8. Add a hover effect to the the LAST div element. Use pseudo-classes for that.

3. Add the same box below the first box and note if you can identify any strange behavior.
 done / margin-collapsing

4. Give the first box a height of 100% of the window height.
done / not really sure what this is asking for.  Div is a BLOCK ELEMENT.  To take the full page height need to use vh (havent gone over this yet, or use pixels for the height maybe)

5. Set the first box back to a more reasonable height of 300px and set its width to 50%.
done

6. Position the two boxes next to each other.
done

7. "Hide" box number 1 and see how that changes the page.
done (commented out the code though bc I want to see both boxes right now)

8. Add a hover effect to the the LAST div element. Use pseudo-classes for that.
done


Room for improvement:
1) should have used an ID instead of additional class (.box-one)
2) should have remembered that surrounding elements of box-elements act as its container
    to make the height of this div 100%, needed to make the HTML and BODY elements height 100% first.
